## Course Description

The course will cover the mathematical tools and concepts required for the first year sequence of the Master in Economics. The main goal of the course is to prepare for first year classes by reviewing or introducing fundamental concepts in various domains of mathematics: real analysis, linear algebra, calculus and optimization. While studying these topics, we will refine proof-writing skills and develop familiarity with mathematical rigor and formality. Emphasis will also be put on problem-solving and application of the tools. While the course is largely self-contained, students are expected to have taken courses in elementary analysis and unidimensional calculus, as well as have some familiarity with concepts in linear algebra.

The class will be taught in a hybrid format from Monday August 14th to Thursday August 31st. Lectures will be held in person (Hamilton 517) every weekday from 9.30am to 12pm EST ; they will simultaneously be available on Zoom as well as recorded for asynchronous attendance. If possible, students are strongly encouraged to attend the lectures in real time.

The course is largely self-contained. Lecture notes will be posted on the website ; teaching itself will mostly take place on the blackboard but additional notes or slides might be provided. Some additional notes and textbook references are provided below.

Problem sets will be assigned weekly. These are important practice and will be graded for feedback, although no grade will be given for the class. Problem sets will have to be submitted online (modalities to be specified) and will have to be typed, in order to be graded. LaTeX is very strongly encouraged as it is an extremely valuable skill that students should acquire as soon as possible. There will be a final exam, the date and modality of the exam will be announced later.

The problem sets will have to be typed and students are encouraged to use LaTeX. LaTeX is a powerful tool for seamless and systematic typesetting that produces clean and readable documents. It is arguably the best practical options to typeset mathematical notations and it is the standard tool in the academic world in Economics. For those that are not familiar with LaTeX, here are a few references to get started :
* The website [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) is a great practical way to get started with LaTeX. You can create a free account and work on LaTeX documents without having to install anything on your computer, it is all browser based. Furthermore, [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) has some useful templates and a [very good guide to getting started with LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) (which is useful even you choose to use another editor) and [many tutorials](https://www.overleaf.com/learn).
* If you prefer to install a local LaTeX distribution and editor on your laptop, there are several good options that come "pre-packaged" with everything you need. Notable among those are [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/) for Windows or [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) for MacOS, which includes the editor [TeXshop](https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/) and a number of useful packages.
* [LyX](https://www.lyx.org/) is an alternative LaTeX-based software that wraps it in a more visual "Word-like" environment which I strongly suggest for starters.
* For the more adventurous, you can download separately a [LaTeX distribution](https://www.latex-project.org/) and then pair it with any editor you like (VSCode, Sublime Text, Atom,...)
* Another good guide to LaTeX : [The Not So Short Guide to LaTeX](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiI69WrmojxAhUPZd8KHcL6D4kQFjAAegQIAxAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftobi.oetiker.ch%2Flshort%2Flshort.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2H-66YoZTXtmBuNDfl3mcl)
* A useful guide for all the math command that you might need in the AMS package : [Short Math Guide for LaTeX](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwis9OzumojxAhWOT98KHQE6BFgQFjAAegQIBBAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftug.ctan.org%2Finfo%2Fshort-math-guide%2Fshort-math-guide.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2xgiC2cYnygUWte5jHJYyo)
* There are a lot of good LaTeX tutorials out there, don't hesitate to look for them and see if you find one you like. Most importantly, after you grasp the general idea of how LaTeX works, you'll learn the most by just using it and figuring out how to do what you need to do.
